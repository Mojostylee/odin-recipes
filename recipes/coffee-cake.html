    <h3>Crunchy, chewy goodness</h3>
        <p>This wonderful cake can be enjoyed anytime of the day. Althought there is zero coffee in the cake itself it does pair with coffee magically! The common theme of coffee cakes is the use of streusel and a topping of as much crumble as the cake will hold. </p>
    <h2><em>Tips for this recipe:</em></h2>
       <ul>
        <li>Don't overmix the batter. It should be thick and pretty smooth, but some small lumps are fine. The batter is thicker than regular cake batter.</li>
        <li>To spread the top layer of batter without lifting it from the cinnamon sugar middle, grease a silicone or metal offset spatula.</li>
        <li>Use real butter for the crumb topping. Margarine or anything else will not give the same results.</li>
        <li>If your streusel topping is browning too quickly, tent the pan loosely with foil and move the cake to the lower third of the oven for the rest of the baking time.</li>
       </ul>
