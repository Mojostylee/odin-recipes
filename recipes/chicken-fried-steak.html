    <h2>Tender, juicy and irresistibly crispy!</h2>
        <p>The aptly named chicken-fried steak is a dish that consists of steak fried in the same manner as fried chicken. The meat is coated with a seasoned flour mixture, then deep-fried to crispy perfection. A Southern favorite, chicken-fried steak is actually very similar to Wiener schnitzel (an iconic Austrian dish of breaded and fried veal).</p>
