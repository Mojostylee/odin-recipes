    <h3>Crunchy, chewy goodness</h3>
    <p>This wonderful cake can be enjoyed anytime of the day. Althought there is zero coffee in the cake itself it does pair with coffee magically! The common theme of coffee cakes is the use of streusel and a topping of as much crumble as the cake will hold. </p>
